For the frontend part, I've worked with Bootstrap 4 and web pack to manage well the CSS and JS.

## How to install on docker-compose

`# Clone this git repo:`

`git clone https://github.com/sguiderk/symfony_addressBookModule.git`

`cd symfony_addressBookModule/`

`docker-compose up --build`

`docker-compose php bin/console doctrine:schema:creat`

 Please make sure that your folder var/logs have all permissions 777
 to allow docker write on this folder ==> chmod -R 777 var/logs

Then it will open yourhost:8000 and the application will be running.
